RYDE is a Ruby on Rails app that allows users to book space travel. Pilots connect with passengers to arrange travel, and passengers are given the opportunity to greatly expand their travels.

## Major Features

### Responsive Design

The RYDE webapp is fully responsive, prioritizing ease-of-use for mobile users. The layout of the site is clean, reducing the amount of visual noise that mobile users experience.

### Security

Users are not able to view another user's personal information; all they are allowed to see is the profile picture, first name, and last initial of the user with whom they are interacting. Additionally, based on one's status as a pilot or passenger, there are pages that users do not have permission to access, resulting in a redirect to a page suitable for their viewing.

### Ryde History

Once a ryde is completed, it does not fade into the aether; users can check their ryde history to see how much time and money they have spent on travel. Users are also able to use this feature to show their friends all of the places they've been.

## Next Steps

The icebox for this project is huge; I could probably spend weeks on it and still have more that can be done.

Top on the list would be implementing a payment API for real transactions to be possible.

Also high on the list is an integration of the Google Maps, Uber, or Lyft API so that users can easily find and/or get to their launch locations. 

Another great option for futhering the app would be a rating system so that pilots and passengers can rate the quality of experience interacting with each other. This should maintain decorum between users.
